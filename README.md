## How does the Cash_Counter work

Cash Counter looks like the same window in the picture

The application window has the cash fields with labels, where you need to write digits, the clear button and the result string.
It works at the real time. Just write some digit in Cash fields and it will be counted.
Pay attention to that russian release supports linguistic cases for words "Рубли" и "Копейки".

Basically, if you want to start a new calculation, you can close and restart Cash_counter. But you can also use the clear button. After clicking on this red-labeled button, the checkout fields will be cleared and the result will be

  "0 рублей, 0 копеек"
  
And you can start to recruit new cash numbers and they will be recalculated again.

If you write something other than a number in the cache field, the application will interpret it as "0" (zero). Be careful.
